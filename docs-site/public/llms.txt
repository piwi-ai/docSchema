# DocSchema

> DocSchema is an open standard for AI-readable JSON schemas that define document types, entity types, conditional requirements, and workflows for Intelligent Document Processing (IDP). It powers the PIWI platform and is designed for community adoption.

Important notes:
- DocSchema defines four core primitives: Document Types, Entity Types, Conditional Requirements, and Workflows
- All schemas are validated against the `docschema.schema.json` meta-schema
- Configurations are organized by business vertical (e.g. Real Estate, Insurance) and country
- The standard supports 33 countries with 100+ document type schemas
- WebMCP tools are available on this site for AI agents to programmatically query all schemas
